    A Breakout clone I wrote from scatch

    If I had 8 more weeks to work on this project I would focus first on polish. I would add a main menu to start and quit from, and a settings menu to choose a language. 
    Then I would incorporate more detailed graphics for the objects and background, and update the music and sound effects. To make the game more substantial, I would add 
    more unique levels. I could also incorporate a highscore system by writing to a file. After cleaning up the game's appearance, I would then work on expanding the game 
    with new gameplay elements. For example, I could add different types of blocks, power ups, and game modes. Finally, if there is time, I would incorporate ways for the 
    player to customize the game, such as custom backgrounds and music. <br>
    <br>
    My level loading system would have to be much more robust to incorporate these new gameplay elements. I also need to figure out how to more accurately detect collisions, 
    since right now occasionally the ball doesn't bounce when it hits a block. There is also this unfortunate problem that MinGW doesn't seem to cooperate with std::filesystem 
    which makes it more difficult to write and read from files. I need to figure out a workaround for that.
