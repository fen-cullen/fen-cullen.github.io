    		If I had 8 more weeks to work on this project I would focus first on polish. I would add a main menu to start and quit from, and a settings menu to choose a 
		language. Then I would incorporate more detailed graphics for the objects and background, and update the music and sound effects. To make the game more 
		substantial, I would add more unique levels. I could also incorporate a highscore system by writing to a file. After cleaning up the game's appearance, I would 
		then work on expanding the game with new gameplay elements. For example, I could add different types of blocks, power ups, and game modes. Finally, if there is 
		time, I would incorporate ways for the player to customize the game, such as custom backgrounds and music.
	</p>

		My level loading system would have to be much more robust to incorporate these new gameplay elements. I also need to figure out how to more accurately detect 
		collisions, since right now occasionally the ball doesn't bounce when it hits a block. There is also this unfortunate problem that MinGW doesn't seem to 
		cooperate with std::filesystem which makes it more difficult to write and read from files. I need to figure out a workaround for that.
